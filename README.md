# [jekyll dash](https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash) without plugins  

Jekyll Dash is a Jekyll theme made by bitbrain.

## Introduction  
The original one includes some plugins that isn't availible on GitHub Pages.  
And using plugins seems to be difficult for amateur.  
(yes i CAN'T understand what he write about the pucking flugins)

It looks totally different between mine and the original one.  
I am going to write a blog(Chinese) later to introduce how to custom.

Yep, I am a noob. So if you have any question, please ask bitbrain, the creator, for help.
